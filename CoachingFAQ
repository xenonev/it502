                    <h3>All you ever wanted to know about Coaching!</h3>

                    <p>Many people use coaching during periods of life
                    transition, change, or when they want to achieve a new
                    level of skill and satisfaction in their business or
                    personal life. Structured assessments and high-impact
                    coaching conversations help identify your strengths,
                    harness them to address your challenges, and ultimately
                    reach full potential in all aspects of your life. You can
                    anticipate that every personal coaching session will be
                    stimulating, energizing, insight-oriented, and
                    transformative. Genuine, lasting success is more likely to
                    result when the client formulates his or her own solution,
                    rather than being told what he or she ought to do by
                    someone else. A "solutions based" approach is significantly
                    more effective than a "problems based" approach. The
                    solutions based approach forms the foundation of Csilla’s
                    coaching practice. When the client develops deeper insight
                    and an action plan that comes from within, the outcome can
                    be astonishing. In my role as a mentor, consultant and
                    manager I learned how to help clients uncover their own
                    truth and tell their own story their way, then help them
                    identify patterns. Through open, judgment free
                    conversations we uncover and explore these patterns and
                    develop an action plan in order to get you aligned with
                    your values and what you have always loved and wanted to do
                    - but may have forgotten about or put aside or been fearful
                    of. With this fresh insight, we’ll develop a set of goals
                    and work in partnership to achieve them.</p>

                    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                    <h4>Who hires a coach?</h4>

                    <p>People who find themselves at a crossroads or critical
                    juncture and are looking for something more&nbsp;or
                    something</p>

                        <li>to make changes</li>

                        <li>to solve problems</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>How does coaching work?</h4>

                    <p>Openness and an ability to be frank are essential in the
                    coaching relationship. An effective coach is a careful
                    listener and a trusted confidante who understands that the
                    client's success is the ultimate goal of the coaching
                    experience. Coaching requires give and take between client
                    and coach, and the client must be able to fully engage with
                    the coach in order to derive maximum benefit.</p>

                    <h4>What kinds of topics can i explore?</h4>

                    <p>The simple answer is: that is entirely up to you.
                    Clients often want to address their career goals, improve
                    their workplace presence, tackle tough conversations,
                    manage challenging interpersonal interactions, implement
                    personal growth strategies, get more done, or strive for
                    work/life balance.</p>

                    <h4>What will my coach and i do&gt;</h4>

                    <p>Mostly, we will talk, explore and reflect. The initial
                    phase is an in-depth assessment of your needs and wants.
                    This is typically followed by determining a goal – i.e.
                    what you hope to achieve through coaching. Goals can range
                    from the modest and practical to those that will stretch
                    you, but always achievable, measurable, and relevant.During
                    coaching sessions, keen listening and stimulating questions
                    are aimed at helping you find a response to your own
                    challenges. Coaching tools and techniques will be
                    integrated into the session as appropriate.</p>

                    <h4>Will there be "homework"?</h4>

                    <p>Sometimes it can be helpful for you to do assignments as
                    follow up from our session. That may consist of filling out
                    a questionnaire or go through an exercise to clarify
                    certain aspects of our discussion, or of a specific task
                    for you to accomplish between sessions.</p>

                    <h4>Don't people just hire a coach because they want
                    someone to talk to?</h4>

                    <p>This can be an element of it, although it's not the sole
                    purpose. Leaders may not have many people with whom they
                    can confide, vent, acknowledge challenges, or strategize to
                    institute change. One of the Coach’s roles is to offer a
                    non-judgmental strategic partner who can "give it to them
                    straight."</p>

                    <h4>Is coaching for me</h4>

                    <p>The first meeting is complimentary. Let’s chat and see.
